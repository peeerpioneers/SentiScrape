# Contributor Code of Conduct

Welcome to SentiScrape! We’re building a tool that blends technical rigor with creative insight — and we want this space to reflect that same spirit.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone — regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences
- Offering constructive feedback
- Gracefully accepting correction
- Giving credit where credit is due

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments
- Personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information
- Commercial use of the project without honoring the license terms

## Enforcement

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that violate this Code of Conduct.
